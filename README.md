# typerHelper
A script for After Effects

typerHelper v0.5

This script is for mocking up typing/keyboard interactions in After Effects. Simply add layers to your comp, add the script, input a string, and render out the keycaps.

Note: Word wrap isn't fully implemented, and the current limit is two lines. Uppercase characters aren't supported right now either.
